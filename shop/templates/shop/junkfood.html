<h3>Get Sick In The Junk Food Generation</h3>
<p class="text-justify">If there’s one thing that’s typically always true about human beings, it’s that they love to eat. Now when I say eat, I mean consume a lot of food. But guess what? We’re not talking carrots and celery here. Generally we prefer to gorge on junk food galore. Why? Simply due to the fact that it tastes great! There’s certainly a satisfaction that comes with snacking on some nachos or scarfing down a brownie sundae. My apologies if I’m making you hungry. Anyway, different individuals have a different take on whether junk food should be consumed or not. If you ask me, I’d say that all of those tasty sweets and snacks are okay to nibble on, if you put a limit on how much and how often you indulge. Naturally there should be a limit to your junk food intake.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><i>“You are what you eat eats” Think about that one for a moment…</i></p>

<p class="text-justify">What would you consider to be unhealthy or junk food? Most people pinpoint fast food restaurants and sweets. At this point, I think it’s pretty obvious what falls into the junk food category and what does not. Treats like chips, movie theater concessions, candy, chocolate, soft drinks, cakes, pies, and pizza are all clearly foods that do nothing great for your body or health. However, we all already know this. But it definitely doesn’t stop us from purchasing these foods on a routine basis. I even know health nuts who eat poorly on occasion. Hey, we all love some junk food. Therefore we’ll all look for ways to eat it sometimes, whether we typically stick to a well-balanced diet or not. When it comes down to it, much of the convenient foods that are bad for you, are also convenient and often less pricey than the healthy foods.
